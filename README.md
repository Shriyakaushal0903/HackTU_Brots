# LoanVault

# Problem
Traditional banking systems rely heavily on CIBIL scores, excluding millions of individuals—such as gig workers, first-time borrowers, and those from rural areas—who lack a formal credit history. Banks also spend significant time and manpower manually verifying documents and assessing risk.

# Solution
We leverage XGBoost-based machine learning models to predict loan approval likelihood based on alternative data points such as income and demographic factors. Additionally, we integrate OCR technology to automate document verification, extracting and validating details from Aadhaar cards and income slips(if applicable) in real-time.

# Technologies Used
1. ML Model: XGBoost Ensemble Model
2. OCR Tesseract for document verification
3. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
4. Backened: Flask

# Benefits
Our solution is not customer centric, it mainly focus on reducing the tasks and working of Banks and NBFCs 
1. Helps banks to expand their customer base.
2. Reduces manual efforts of bankers.
3. Faster Loan Processing.
